Version control is a great tool that designers should take advantage of. What Version Control does is it keeps record of different versions of a project you are working on that can be accessed later in time. So, say you are on your fifth version of a project and want to compare it to the first version. That is possible with Version Control. It is also a great tool to use if you mess up or lose a file since you can revert to older versions and regain a something you may have lost. Version Control can also be used for users of an application by utilizing older versions that may have worked better for them. I was interested in this topic because I know on the AppStore I have read people saying they’re using a older version of Facebook and I never knew how that was possible. Turns out that is due to version control!

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a form of Version Control, but comes with some very useful advantages. According to the history of git, it was built upon five core values including: speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. Git was developed in 2005 and to this day has maintained its ability to be easy to use and extremely fast, even when dealing with large projects. Git is different from other version control systems in the way it thinks about data. In git, the enter button is the ultimate save button. Anytime the enter button is pressed (and a change has been made) a snapshot of all the files in that moment is created and stored away to be accessed again if needed. This makes git like a file system that stores all your files with ease and efficiency instead of a list of changes like most other VCs.  I thought this was interesting because it gives the user peace of mind that their content will be available when needed and it would actually be difficult to lose any information. </p>

            <p class="lead">
Git is speedy because it is local. What I mean by this is that Git uses only local files to operate. Unlike other VC systems, Git does not need to reach out to a server to compile data and show it on the screen. Since it is localized you see what you want almost instantly. This is especially helpful to times where Wi-Fi may not be accessible but you still want to get some work done.  Although hard to fathom, even in 2018 there are still times that we are not connected to WiFi. Be it a bad connection or even traveling. On a plane where they charge $10 for an hour long flight, you can keep you wallet happy and get work done in Git.

                <span class="text-muted">Home</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in Git basically live in homes. There are three types of “homes” that your files can live in being: committed, modified, and staged.  Committed is the safest out of these homes meaning that your data is saved and stored in the database. Modified is when a file has been changed but has not fully been committed into the database.  Finally, staged is kind of like having a home in escrow. You have a modified file that is ready to go into the committed stage. These different file homes are created in different spots as well.  In the working directory you can modify a file. Once you are done with modifications you mark the file into the staging area to become part of the staged “home.” Finally, you commit to the file which then becomes part of the Git directory. Looking at it this way definitely helped me to understand the Git process better. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to get a Git Repository. You can use a local directory and turn it into a Git Repository or you can clone an existing repository on your local drive. For creating a new repository you need to go to the directory for a project and make git control it by typing: $ git init. This is the new subdirectory and it is ready to start tracking files. You can create commits that have different codes but will probably look something like git commit –m. If you would like to clone an existing repository then you would use the command: git clone. With this command, Git will receive a full copy of all the data in the server! I am guessing this information will come in handy as we dive deeper into Git.</p>
